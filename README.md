Installation
============

Just type "ant jar" to create a jar file of the datastore library.

To compile the library and an example type "ant -Dappengine.dir=<dir> compile"
and replace <dir> with the full path to your appengine sdk directory.

If you want to create a jar of the compiled files type "ant binary-jar".
