;;;; Clojure and the Google App Engine Datastore are a perfect fit. With the low-level API
;;;; you can almost directly store Clojure datastructures natively into the datastore.
;;;; To use the low-level API, we put some simple abstractions on top of it. This way the
;;;; access to the datastore feels more lispy.

;;;; These definitions are needed to understand the code:

;;;; * Entity: An Entity is a record or a struct of data that is stored in the GAE datastore.

;;;; * Translate: In Clojure you can use normal structs. Before you can store a struct into the
;;;;   GAE datastore, it has to be translated, because the datastore can only handle
;;;;   a fixed set of datastructures. If you want to store an instance of a type which is not supported
;;;;   by the datastore, you have to translate it to a supported datatype. Example: If
;;;;   you want to store java.util.Date (which is a supported type, but just to give you an easy example),
;;;;   you might want to translate it into Millis (long) before saving it (pre-save).
;;;;   When you retrieve it from the datastore (post-load), you have to translate it back from Millis to
;;;;   java.util.Date. So in this file, the word "translation" has nothing to do with I18N etc.

;;;; We made it really easy to define such translations. You just use the Macro defentity.
;;;; It takes a list of clauses. Each clause contains a key and optional one or two
;;;; translation functions. The first one is the translate-to-datastore and the second one is the
;;;; translate-from-datastore function. The translation-function can also contain validations or other
;;;; transformations of the data, like changing a string to lower-case.
;;;; An entity is processed in the following steps:
;;;;
;;;; Loading from the datastore:
;;;; datastore -> load -> translate-attributes -> translate entity (post-load) -> entity
;;;;
;;;; Storing in the datastore:
;;;; entity -> translate-entity (pre-save) -> translate attributes -> store -> datastore

;;;; If you don't supply a translation-function, then the identity function is used.

;;;; We supplied some standard translations for the currently supported GAE datatypes, too.


;;;; Using defentity
;;;; ---------------

;;;; Entities that should be stored in the datastore are defined as follows:

(comment
  "This defines an Entity named project, with two properties, :key and :title"
  (defentity project
    [:key]
    [:title :pre-save to-text :post-load from-text]
    :options []))


;;;; The defentity-Macro automatically generates some functions:

;;;; This creates an in-memory struct-map of the type project with the attribute :title set.
;;;; Your entity is not saved to the datastore.

(comment
  (make-project :title "Project1"))

;;;; create a new datastore-entry of the kind "project". The value of the attribute :title
;;;; is translated from String to a GAE Text type type (and is therefore not indexed).
;;;; This saves your Entity to the datastore (persistence = side-effect!).

(comment
  (create-project (make-project :title "Project1")))

;;;; In addition to that, you will find two generated Multi-Methods in your namespace. They are
;;;; used under the hood for the translation. You don't need to call them directly. It is
;;;; all done automatically. They have no side-effects.

(comment
  (translate-from-datastore <your-entity-goes-here>)
  (translate-to-datastore <your-entity-goes-here>))

;;;; RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN ENTITIES
;;;;
;;;; At the moment it's only possible to define parent-key relationships between entities.
;;;; Ex.
;;;; (def-parent-key-relationship project phase)
;;;; creates a function called (phases-for-project-id [project-key queries]) which can be used
;;;; to query the datastore for phases that are children of the given parent-key.
;;;; creates a function called (project-id-of-phase [phase]) which returns the id for a phase
;;;;
;;;;

;;;; CHANGING DATA.
;;;;
;;;; Changing data in entities should not be done directly via (assoc ...) but by using the
;;;; (change ...) function. This keeps a log of changes in the returned entity and can therefore
;;;; be used to check if an entity needs to be updated in the datastore.
